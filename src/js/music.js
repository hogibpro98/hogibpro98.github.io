    help people recycle?

    Unit 3 Growing Roses
    M: Excuse me, ma’am. I have a problem with my
    rose bush. It used to produce a lot of pink roses.
    But now it doesn’t produce any flowers at all.
    W: I see. That does seem like a problem. Do the
    leaves on the plant look healthy?
    M: Not really. The leaves used to be very green.

    use?
    W: This liquid fertilizer is very good. It will help
    make your rose leaves green again. Then the
    plant should produce roses quite soon. The
    fertilizer costs about ten dollars.
    M: How long will it take for my rose bush to recover?

    Where do the bubbles come from when you
    boil water?
    Water is a liquid. When it is heated, it moves
    around faster and faster. When it starts to boil,
    the liquid turns into a gas. This gas is called
    water vapor. This gas is lighter than the water
    around it. It rises to the top. Then it disappears
    into the air.
    As the water gets hotter and hotter, it starts
    turning into gas very quickly. A lot of bubbles
    form at the same time. All these bubbles try to
    escape at once. The bubbles push the water out
    of the way and “jump” out. This is what we call
    “boiling water.”
    More and more water turns into gas. More
    of it disappears into the air. After a while, every
    drop of the water will be gone. Try it and see!

    G : I’ll explain it in a simple way. Light comes
    through the air from the sun in waves.
    B : The light is in many colors, right?
    G : Right. Blue light waves are smaller than air
    molecules. They sometimes get absorbed by
    these molecules.
    B : OK. What happens then?
    G : Then the blue light waves scatter in many
    directions. Your eyes see this blue light from
    above you, after it leaves the air molecules.
    B : So that is what makes the sky blue! What
    happens to the other colors?
    G : They reflect off the things that they hit. Your
    shirt is red because our eyes see the red light

    Gold has been a part of many cultures for

    Gold is a soft metal. It is easy to shape into
    sheets, long wires, or rings. People sometimes
    mix gold with other metals. This makes the gold
    harder. Then it can be made into beautiful jewelry.
    Why do we value gold so much? It has a
    special color. No other metal is a bright yellow.
    We also value gold because it is rare. A rare
    thing is hard to find. Even after hundreds of
    years, gold is still a precious metal now. It is still
    valued for its beauty. It is still rare.
    Today, banks store gold in the form of bars.

    this week. The beads come in different colors
    and shapes. First, we decide what sort of jewelry
    we want to make. Then, we choose the beads we
    want, and string them on transparent plastic
    wire.
    W: That sounds like a lot of fun!
    G : Yeah! Tom made a bead necklace for his sister,
    and I made some earrings. Guess what, Mom? I
    made a pair of earrings for you, too!
    W: Oh, these are very pretty! Thank you very much.
    G : Next week, I’m going to make a necklace.

    There was once a man who lived with his
    two sons. The two sons were always fighting
    with each other. One day, the man decided to
    teach his sons a lesson.
    The man gave his younger son two large
    sticks. He told the boy to break them. The boy
    tried hard, but he could not break the sticks.
    The older son also could not break the sticks.
    At last, the man gave only one stick to each
    son. He said, “Break them.” Each son broke his
    stick easily.
    The man said, “You are like these sticks. If
    you work together, no one can break you. But if
    you fight with each other all the time, one day,
    someone will break both of you.”
    After that lesson, the sons stopped fighting.

    away. The chimps were afraid of her. They ran
    away if she came close to them. After some time,
    the chimps saw that she was not going to hurt
    them. They let her walk near them.
    Soon, she was living among them. She wanted
    to learn more and more about them. Jane did a
    lot of research on chimps. She discovered many
    new things about them. She learned that each
    chimp has its own personality. She saw that they
    have feelings.
    Jane discovered that chimps have very close
    families. Mothers and fathers take good care
    of baby chimps. An adult female chimp will
    sometimes adopt an orphan.
    In 1977, Jane started an institute to help
    protect animals. She wanted to help animals all
    around the world. Today, this institute runs
    programs in over 70 countries.

    spots for each part.
    An expert puts the needles into these spots in

    is the teacher. Another benefit is that students
    can study interesting things.
    Some people think that home schooling is not
    good for students. They believe public schools
    teach children discipline. They feel that public
    schools give a sense of community. In the end,
    parents must decide if home schooling is the right
    choice for their children

    We all need regular exercise to keep fit. But
    if we study all day, we don’t have time to run,
    swim, lift weights, or play basketball. What can
    we do to stay in shape?
    One thing we could do is walk more often.
    Walking is good exercise. Instead of going to
    school by car or bus, we could walk. During
    recess, we could go outside and stroll around
    before we go back to class. Instead of taking the
    elevator in buildings all the time, we could use
    the stairs.
    Another important thing is to take breaks
    from studying. If we sit at our desks or in front of a
    computer for a long time, we should stand up
    and stretch our arms and legs once each hour. If
    we stand for a long time, we should sit down
    and stretch our backs.
    These are just a few ways we can stay fit
    when we don’t have a lot of time to exercise.

    B : I’m sorry, Ms. Terry. I can’t help it!
    W: You can! You yawn because your lungs need
    more oxygen. When you need more oxygen, you
    open your mouth wide and take in a lot of air.
    B : What can I do to stop yawning?
    W: You should go outside into the fresh air and
    breathe deeply. Then you won’t need to yawn
    anymore. Your lungs will have lots of oxygen.
    B : We just came in from recess, so why am I yawning?
    W: Are you tired? Being tired also makes you yawn.
    This is because your body needs rest. Oxygen
    helps your body rest. Sleeping rests your body
    and makes you take long, deep breaths.
    B : Then, why do I yawn when I am bored, Ms.
    Terry?
    W: Well, Jason, when you are bored, you are probably
    not breathing deeply enough. The best way to
    stop yawning from boredom is to do something
    interesting. If you can’t do that, try taking deep
    breaths. This will not stop the boredom, but it

      chemicals around my children. It’s harmful and

      to seep into the garden.
      G : I usually don’t have problems with ants, and I
      don’t use any chemicals.
      W: What’s your secret?
      G : Well, ants are difficult to control, so I planted a
      lot of mint plants near my deck. I also use cinnamon
      and cayenne pepper. I just sprinkle them around the
      places I don’t want ants. Some people have tried it
      and said it worked. Others said that they needed to
      try something else.
      W: I think it’s worth a try. I would rather use cinnamon
      and mint around my patio than some hazardous
      chemicals. Besides, I don’t mind having the ants in
      the yard. I simply don’t want them coming to the
      birthday party. Would you mind helping me?
      G : It would be a pleasure. I have a lot of cinnamon
      at home and I can run to the store to get the
      plants for you.
      W: Thank you, Brianna. You’re such a thoughtful
      person.

      My best friend Katy lives near a beautiful
      white sand beach. Her parents take us there every
      summer. The water is clean and refreshing. We
      have a lot of fun in the waves. Last year, there was
      an oil spill at Katy’s beach. We volunteered at the
      beach to clean up the oil and help the birds that
      were caught in the spill.
      When we arrived at the beach that day, the
      water was slick with oil and the white sand had
      turned black. It was an ugly sight. At first, the
      rescue workers would not let us on the beach.
      We had to watch from a distance. We watched
      as they put a huge float in the water, called a
      boom. This device kept the oil slick from
      spreading. Once they stopped the slick, we were
      allowed on the beach to help. Each of us was
      given a broom. We swept the oil into a pile. The
      workers took it away in big trucks. We all
      worked very hard that day to restore the beach.
      Once the oil was removed, the birds that had
      been caught in the oil had to be helped. The
      workers showed us how to remove the oil from
      their wings. Then the birds could fly away to
      safety. We were very proud of ourselves that day.
      We helped save our beautiful beach and the
      birds who visit it.

      The Amazon is an amazing river. It is unique
      in many ways. It is the second longest river in
      the world. It is 6,500 kilometers long. It starts
      up in the Andes Mountains. Its drainage basin
      (the area of land that collects water) covers 40
      percent of South America. The Amazon River
      has many small rivers that supply it with water.
      It is the widest river in the world. The river
      rises more than nine meters during the rainy season.
      It overflows its banks. It floods large areas of the
      rainforest. During that time, in some parts, it has a
      width of up to 40 kilometers. The Amazon River is
      over 325 kilometers wide at its mouth. It has more
      water than any other river in the world.
      The Amazon River is also home to many animals.
      Over 2,000 types of fish live in the Amazon
      River. One kind of fish is the piranha. The piranha
      is a terrifying fish. A piranha grows up to 60
      centimeters long. It hunts in a group. A group of
      piranha can kill and eat cattle in a matter of minutes.
      They are so efficient that only the bones are left.
      This fish is one of the most dangerous creatures in
      the Amazon River.

      The highlight of the year for us is the annual

      who won last year’s competition, so I think we
      have a really good chance of winning.
      Our robot is about 30 centimeters high. It
      weighs two kilograms. It should be really quick.

      One of the greatest achievements in the

      to people since 1901. There are prizes for physics,
      chemistry, and medicine. There are also prizes for
      literature, economics, and peace. The Nobel
      Prize is named after Alfred Nobel. He was born
      in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1833. Alfred Nobel
      invented dynamite in 1866. Dynamite is used in
      mining, construction, and war. Before he died, he
      wrote that all of his money should be used to
      create the Nobel Prize. He died in 1896. The
      first prize was given in 1901.
      Each prize has three parts: a diploma, a gold
      medal, and money. The money has increased
      since 1980. It is now ten million Swedish crowns.
      This is about one million euros. How are the
      winners chosen? Five committees secretly meet to
      pick the winners. The Nobel Prize for Economics
      is the only one that is not decided that way. That
      is because it was created in 1956 by the Bank of
      Sweden in honor of the fiftieth anniversary of
      Alfred Nobel’s death. The Bank of Sweden decides
      who gets the Nobel Prize for Economics. Since
      1901, over 750 people have won the Nobel Prize.

      What makes a painting a great work of art?
      There are many answers to that question. Some
      people think that a painting should look pretty.
      Others disagree. The skill of the painter is
      important. The techniques used are also important.
      Most of all, a great painting has meaning. A
      great painting has a special element in it.
      Sometimes, a painter’s special element is the
      way he portrays his or her feelings in a piece of
      art. An example of this is Picasso’s painting,
      Guernica. It has strange shapes in it. It shows
      suffering people, too. It is not a very pretty picture.
      However, it makes people understand Picasso’s
      feelings about war.
      Other times, the element is a memory or feeling.
      This comes from inside another person. Someone
      may see a painting and be reminded of a beautiful
      memory. A painting can also remind people of a
      feeling. For example, Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona
      Lisa is very popular. Many people like her smile.
      Some people say it is a mysterious smile. Others
      say it is a happy one. Still others make up stories
      about the woman in the painting.
      Which element is the most important? Is it
      the skill of the artist or the feelings of the person
      looking at the painting? Whatever the case, a
      painting that grabs people’s emotions is popular.

      barrel drums.
      B : Barrel drums? What are those?
      M: They are made with hollow logs and animal
      skins. First, they cut down a tree. They cut a section
      that’s about as thick and tall as a barrel. They
      stretch an animal skin over the top, and tie it to
      the sides with wooden pegs. These pegs can be

      a hollow tree trunk that’s smaller than a barrel
      drum, and leave an opening at both ends. Then
      they fit an animal skin on each end. There’s a
      string between each of these ends. When a player
      holds the drum under an armpit and squeezes, it
      tightens the string and raises the pitch.
      B : Why do they call it a “talking” drum?

      drums imitate human voices. They seem to cry,

      It happens a lot. So many people visit and
      live in foreign countries nowadays. The culture
      and manners of every country are different. It is likely that a foreigner will say or do something
      inappropriate. This is called a faux pas. In one
      culture, it is fine to do something one way. In
      another culture, it is rude.
      For example, my friend visited a relative in
      Israel. She offered to wash the dishes. She did not
      know that it was important to wash the meat
      dishes with a special sponge. She used the wrong
      sponge. Her friend’s father was very upset. In
      Canada, it is fine to use the same sponge to wash
      all of the dishes, but not in Israel.
      Something similar happened to me when I
      visited a temple in India. I was surprised when
      two officials stopped me and told me to take off
      my shoes. It was only then that I realized that
      people are not allowed to enter a temple with
      their shoes on. I was very embarrassed. Of
      course, I apologized for my mistake.
      A faux pas is embarrassing. No one wants to
      be rude. No one wants to cause problems.
      However, when two cultures meet, there can be
      misunderstandings. The next time someone is
      rude, be patient and understanding. He may
      think he is acting politely.

      need lemons, sugar, and water. We need something
      to keep our money in, a sign to advertise the
      lemonade, paper cups, and a cardboard box to use
      as a stand.
      B : Should we sell food to go with the lemonade?
      G : I think that would be too complicated. We would
      need a permit and either a cooler or stove. We
      should stick to just selling lemonade.
      B : You’re right, let’s just keep it simple.
      G : OK, let’s get set up and think of a plan to get
      some customers and make some sales!
      B : Why don’t I attract the customers and you serve
      the lemonade?
      G : Sounds good to me.

      When someone does an activity that is not a
      part of his or her job and is done for fun, it is
      called a hobby. Most people enjoy hobbies during
      their free time. Some people spend a lot of time
      on their hobbies. There are nearly as many kinds
      of hobbies, as there are people. A hobby can be
      about making or collecting things, or enjoying an
      experience.
      Creative hobbies are popular. Some creative
      hobbies are writing, drawing, and making pottery.
      A lot of people like making jewelry or clothes.
      People who do these kinds of hobbies sometimes
      become writers or artists when they retire.
      Collecting is also popular. Most collectors used
      to buy coins, stamps, or baseball cards. Today,
      toys, games, and model cars are trendy. Collectors
      buy and sell things on the Internet. They also shop
      online in stores all around the world.
      Enjoying an experience is a hobby, too. Some
      people listen to music. Others watch movies or
      read books. Many people travel or play sports.
      Helping people is a hobby. There are places you
      can help build houses for poor families. You can
      help feed the homeless at soup kitchens. You can
      also tutor children or help the elderly.
      A hobby is something that is done for fun.
      With so many choices, there is no reason not to
      enjoy a hobby.

      B : Yes, Coach?
      M: Jackson, when you’re playing defense, keep
      your knees bent and your body low. It helps you
      keep your balance. And it allows you to move
      more quickly in every direction.
      B : Like this?
      M: That’s right. You should attempt to stay on the
      balls of your feet. It’s like you are getting ready
      to pounce. Athletes never rest on their heels.
      B : Should I stand with my legs close together or far
      apart?
      M: It is best to keep them about shoulder-width apart.
      Bend your knees and keep your back straight.
      Spread your arms straight out at your sides.
      B : This seems almost like I’m getting ready to attack
      the ball.
      M: It is a little bit like that. Your stance looks much
      better than before.
      B : Coach, how do I move forward and backward
      on defense? I feel like my stance is fine, but
      when I try to dart toward my opponent, I keep
      tripping over my feet.
      M: When you move forward, put your right foot in
      front of you, with your toes pointing in the
      direction you want to go. When you move
      backward, just reverse it: follow the direction of
      your left foot. How are you feeling?

      Everyone gets a cold now and then. Doctors
      cannot cure colds. Sleep and rest are good for taking
      care of a cold. However, in almost every culture,
      most families have a home remedy for colds. These
      remedies are passed down from parents to children.
      They have changed very little over time.
      Different cultures use different ingredients.
      In Mexico, cinnamon, raisins, oregano, and hot
      water are used to make a special tea. Honey is
      sometimes added. A fruit called genipap is used
      as a cold remedy in Puerto Rico. The fruit is cut
      up. It is then soaked in water. Sugar can be added
      to make it sweet. Chicken soup is popular in
      America. A large chicken is boiled in a pot.
      Carrots, onions, garlic, and other vegetables are
      usually added. Ginger tea is used to help a cold in
      China. A ginger root is peeled. It is then crushed.
      The ginger is boiled for about thirty minutes.
      Some honey can be added after it is done.
      Each family usually has a home remedy for
      a cold. Some remedies work. Some do not. Some
      taste good. Others do not. No matter what,
      home remedies are sure to be around for a long
      time.

      Soccer is one of the most popular sports in
      the world. Although the main idea of the game
      is easy to understand, there are many rules to be
      followed.
      A player gets a yellow card for not following
      the rules. A yellow card is a warning. If a player
      keeps breaking the rules, he gets a red card.
      When this happens, he cannot play anymore. He
      is ejected from the game.
      Another rule is about “handling.” “Handling”
      is when another player touches the ball with his
      hands on purpose. Players cannot handle the ball.
      A player may not do anything that is dangerous
      to another player. He cannot kick an opponent’s
      legs to get the ball.
      There are also some lesser-known rules. A
      player is not allowed to impede an opponent.
      This means that a player cannot purposely slow
      down another player on the field. A penalty can
      be called if this occurs. There is a rule about
      blocking a goalkeeper, too. A yellow card or an
      indirect kick can be given to the opponent’s
      team if a player tries this. Yes, soccer is full of
      rules!

      Asking for directions can be risky. I realized
      exactly how risky it could be when I needed to
      meet one of my friends one day.
      A while ago, I arranged to meet my friend at
      a new mall. My friend had been there before and
      indicated that we should shop there together.
      We planned to meet at 3:00 p.m. at Burger
      Palace in the mall.
      When I arrived at the mall, I realized I did not
      know where Burger Palace was, so I asked a
      woman for directions. She advised me to go
      straight past the bank, and turn right before the
      food court. She mentioned that I would walk
      for a few minutes, passing a shoe store until I
      reached Burger Palace, which was next to the
      bookstore. I followed her directions and arrived
      just in time.
      Twenty minutes later, I was beginning to
      wonder where my friend was. Thirty minutes
      later, I was worried. I did not know what to do,
      so I just kept waiting. At around 3:40 p.m., I saw
      my friend walking quickly toward me. I rushed to
      him and demanded to know what happened. “I
      was at the other Burger Palace!” he cried. We
      had not realized there were two Burger Palaces
      in the mall.

      When your car gets a flat tire, do not panic.
      First, apply your brakes and pull over. Inside
      the trunk, you will find a spare tire and a toolbox. 
      AOne of these tools is a jack, which is a tool
      you use to raise the car. This makes the tire easy to
      remove. Position the jack beneath the car, behind
      the tire that is flat. Insert the jack handle and turn
      it clockwise. Continue turning the handle until the
      car rises high enough, so that the flat tire is well
      off the ground and spins freely. Make sure that the
      jack is securely supporting the vehicle. If the car is
      unsteady or the jack is unstable, lower the car.
      Reposition the jack and begin again.
      Next, use a crowbar to pry off the hubcap
      (the metal cover on the side of the tire). Inside
      the hubcap are four bolts that hold the tire in
      place. Loosen these, using the long L-shaped
      tool. Push firmly on the tool to get the bolts to
      turn. It may be difficult.
      Once the bolts are loose, the flat tire can be
      pulled off easily. Now you can put on the new
      tire. Once it is in place, replace the four bolts and
      tighten them. Place the flat tire and the toolbox
      back in the trunk.
      Finally, drive to the nearest service station
      and get your flat tire fixed!

    Some animals in cold climates hibernate.
    This means that they spend the winter months in
    a very long and deep sleep. Many animals find
    shelter underground. They dig out shelters to
    sleep in. Animals that cannot dig find cracks or
    holes at the base of trees and bushes. If they like
    the place they find, they might use it for years
    and years.
    Animals that hibernate include cold-blooded
    animals, such as lizards, frogs, and snakes. Many
    warm-blooded animals also hibernate, such as
    mice, bats, and squirrels. When these animals
    are hibernating, they seem like they are not alive
    at all. Warm-blooded animals seem colder to the
    touch. However, their blood is still very warm.
    Hibernating animals have a very slow heartbeat.
    They almost stop breathing. Extra blood sugar
    and fat in their bodies keep them alive. They eat
    lots of food just before they hibernate.
    Winters that do not stay cold are dangerous
    for hibernating animals. They can sometimes
    wake up in their shelters when it gets a little
    warm. Then they use energy by moving around.
    During winter, there is very little food. These
    animals can get very thin and weak. If they move
    around too much and do not eat, they can die.
    Animals hibernate to escape the cold. There
    are also animals in hot climates that escape the
    heat. During very hot or dry weather, they sleep
    underground. This is called aestivation.

    Autumn, or fall, is the season between summer
    and winter. The days become shorter, and the air
    gets cooler. Trees sense these changes, so they
    start preparing for colder weather.
    Trees that have leaves block water and food
    from coming through the branches to the leaves.
    When this happens, the leaves die. They fall off
    the tree or the wind blows them away. This is
    why autumn is usually called fall in America. As
    the leaves start to die, they appear to change
    from green to red, yellow, orange, or brown.
    Actually, the leaves are really these colors all
    year long. They look green because of a chemical
    called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll works with the
    sun to help the trees make food. In autumn,
    when there is less sun, the tree cannot make
    chlorophyll, so the green color fades. This
    reveals other colors, like red and yellow, that
    were always in the leaves.
    Like trees, animals also sense changes in the
    cooler autumn climate. Animals that hibernate
    eat a lot during autumn. They gain weight to store
    energy in the form of fat. They use this energy to
    survive the winter while hibernating. Many birds
    survive the cold in a different way: they leave.
    Each year, many birds migrate south to warmer
    climates during autumn. They migrate north
    again in the spring. Not a bad idea if you ask
    me! After all, who would refuse a mid-winter trip
    to sunny Thailand?

    The death of the dinosaurs is a great mystery.
    About 65 million years ago, dinosaurs lived all
    over the Earth. They had existed for nearly 200
    million years. Suddenly, they all became extinct.
    Many scientists believe that the dinosaurs
    were killed by a large meteor. They think that
    this meteor was about six to twelve miles wide.
    It crashed into southern Mexico and made a
    hole about 130 miles wide. The crash threw dust
    and dirt into the sky. Dust clouds darkened the
    Earth’s atmosphere. The crash caused fires,
    earthquakes, and tidal waves. The plants were
    killed. The oceans were poisoned. Very soon,
    there was no food left for the plant-eating
    dinosaurs. When they died, there was no food
    for the meat-eating dinosaurs. The meteor killed
    almost 70 percent of all plants and animals on
    Earth. The only animals that could survive were
    small ones that could eat many different kinds
    of food.
    Some scientists say the meteor alone did not
    cause dinosaurs to become extinct. They think
    that dinosaurs were already getting weaker.
    They are not sure why. One reason might be
    disease. Another might be climate change. A big
    part of the mystery is why some types of animals
    survived. If climate change killed dinosaurs, it
    should also have killed frogs. If the meteor killed
    most sea reptiles, it should have killed crocodiles.

    what that is. Have you ever been kept awake at
    night because of the sound of traffic, or people
    talking, or loud music? These types of noise are
    sometimes called dark noise. Dark noise is made
    up of sounds that bother you so much that you
    can’t concentrate on what you are doing.
    White noise is not exactly noise; in fact,
    white noise can’t be heard at all. White noise is
    made up of invisible waves of sound that reduce
    the effects of dark noise by making sounds of
    the opposite frequency. It’s like being in the
    ocean and seeing a large wave coming toward
    you. It might knock you down. But if you could
    send a wave, or many small waves, toward the
    big wave, it wouldn’t be as powerful, because
    the small waves would hit it and reduce its size.
    My machine does this with sound. As a sound
    enters the microphone, the machine determines
    the sound’s frequency. Then it makes a sound in the
    opposite frequency that cancels out the first sound.
    I hope my machine will give some peace and quiet
    to people living in noisy places. Thank you.

    It says that the MP4 player is 3.6 inches tall and
    two inches wide, but what does that mean in
    centimeters?
    G : Well, according to my math book, one inch
    equals 2.54 centimeters, so to convert that, we
    need to multiply each English measurement by
    that number. Wait, I have a calculator in my
    pocket.
    B : Great!
    G : According to the calculator, that would make it
    9.1 centimeters tall and, let’s see, about five
    centimeters wide.
    B : So, its height is about nine centimeters and its
    width is about five centimeters, but what about
    its weight? The website says that it weighs 3.6
    ounces.
    G : We multiply 3.6 by 28.3, which is the equivalent
    in grams, and that converts to about 102 grams.
    B : All right then, the MP4 player is about nine
    centimeters tall and five centimeters wide, and
    weighs about 102 grams. I thought it would
    have to have larger dimensions to be able to
    hold 5,000 songs, but it’s small and light! Do
    you think I should buy it, Julie?
    G : It sounds like a good product, but it depends on

    Computers have transformed the way people
    communicate. In some ways this transformation
    is good, but in other ways it could be harmful.
    Statistics show that millions of people use the
    Internet every day. People shop online, play
    games, and search for information. Studies also
    show that people use the Internet mainly for
    communication.
    The Internet has made communication fast
    and convenient. Email can travel anywhere
    within seconds. Chat rooms include people from
    all over the world. People can even make
    Internet telephone calls.
    However, this type of communication is very
    different from what people did in the past.
    People spend less time talking face to face. They
    might “chat” for days without being in the same
    room with a real person. They also might
    communicate with many people at the same
    time. Some researchers think this is unhealthy.
    One study on Internet use found that people
    who used the Internet a lot were lonely. Also,
    they did not communicate as much with members
    of their family.
    Many people have criticized this study. They
    say it did not include enough people and that
    loneliness is hard to measure. In my opinion, all
    types of communication are good. It is great to
    email someone and get a fast response. It is also
    nice to talk face to face. We can do both. The
    Internet is a fantastic tool. We should use it
    wisely to benefit from it.

    Hi. My name is Sandy. Welcome to physics,
    my favorite class. Although there are 30 students
    in our class, only six of us are girls.
    Most of my friends don’t like science as
    much as I do. They are convinced that science
    and mathematics are “boys’ subjects.” They say
    that boys learn about science and mathematics
    by playing with toys like building blocks, racing
    cars, and simple machines, while girls play with
    toys like dolls and tea sets. They say their parents
    didn’t do science experiments with them or
    encourage them to learn math.
    Well, that wasn’t the case with me! I played
    with dolls, too, but my parents also built up my
    confidence in science and math. They used long
    plastic rods, which are like sticks, to help me
    learn addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
    division. For my eighth birthday, they gave me a
    kids’ chemistry set, which helped me do all sorts
    of cool experiments! Whenever we went to the
    park, my parents asked me different questions
    about the plants and animals that we saw. When
    we got home, we looked up the answers together.
    In school, my teachers were surprised. They
    were used to boys giving all the answers in
    science class. They were impressed with my
    science exam scores. I have lots of confidence in
    myself. I know that boys are not smarter than
    girls in science and math classes. I just wish I
    could convince my friends!

    Love. Hate. Death. These things are at the
    heart of Shakespeare’s famous tragedy, Romeo
    and Juliet. The St. Stephens High School drama
    club performed this play last weekend.
    Romeo and Juliet is the story of two families,
    the Capulets and the Montagues, who are bitter
    enemies. Tragedy follows when the son of one
    falls in love with the daughter of the other. The
    play is set in Verona, Italy, in the late 16th century.
    Allison Bourne played Juliet, Capulet’s
    beautiful young daughter. She showed the mixed
    emotions Juliet felt after secretly marrying the
    son of her family’s most hated enemy. At times,
    she was happy, and at times, she was afraid.
    David Taylor played Romeo, Montague’s
    son. He put on a good performance despite
    having a head cold. His lines were said with
    great feeling in a clear voice.
    Eric Parker was the perfect Tybalt: dark and
    angry. Maggie Jones played the nurse. She acted
    the part of a gossipy old woman very well. She
    made everyone in the audience laugh at her
    jokes and her comic character.
    The whole cast showed enthusiasm in every
    scene. The actors knew the meaning of their
    lines. They used body language to show this
    meaning well. The stage lights were sometimes
    too bright or too dim. But the sword fights looked
    very real, and the costumes were wonderful.
    Overall, St. Stephens’ production of Romeo
    and Juliet was a great night of high school theater.

    The Mona Lisa is one of the most famous
    paintings in the world. It was painted by the
    great Italian artist, Leonardo da Vinci, between
    the years 1503 and 1505. The portrait was done
    with oil paint on a simple piece of wood. The
    portrait shows a woman in front of a landscape
    with mountains. Many people believe that the
    model for the painting was the wife of an important
    man in the area. However, some people now
    think that da Vinci actually drew a picture of
    himself. They say the face looks similar to his.
    Apparently, da Vinci loved the painting so much
    that he carried it with him at all times until he
    sold it to the king of France.
    The portrait is famous for several reasons.
    The best-known reason is for Mona Lisa’s
    unusual smile. It is difficult to say if she is being
    pleasant or looking arrogant. Another reason
    the painting is famous is that it was stolen from
    an art museum in 1911. Both France and Italy
    sent people to look for the lost painting. It was
    then found two years later in a hotel in France.
    It is currently on display at the Louvre Museum
    in Paris. People from all over the world go to the
    museum each year to see the Mona Lisa. In fact,
    the painting has so much appeal today that it
    has been copied many times.

    When most people hear the name Leonardo
    da Vinci, they think of art. But in fact, he was a
    man of many talents. He was a scientist, an
    inventor, and an artist.
    Leonardo da Vinci was born in 1452 in
    Vinci, Italy. When he was 14, his father sent him
    to Florence to train under Andrea del Verrocchio,
    one of the best artists in the area. Leonardo
    became better than Verrocchio. By his early
    twenties, Leonardo was famous for his painting.
    He was especially good at painting colors and
    details. This made his paintings very lifelike. His
    most famous paintings are the Mona Lisa and
    The Last Supper.
    Leonardo was also a great scientist. He was
    a good observer of life and nature. He would
    ask himself simple questions like, “How do
    birds fly?” Then he would try to find the answers.
    He was interested in everything. For example,
    he studied the inner workings of the human
    body. He would cut up dead bodies to examine
    their insides.
    Leonardo was also a talented inventor. He
    believed that by understanding how each part of
    a machine worked, the parts could be changed
    and combined in different ways to make new
    machines. Using his artistic talent, Leonardo drew
    pictures of many inventions. However, few of
    them were built and tested during his lifetime.
    For example, his parachute wasn’t built until
    1783. Also, his war tank wasn’t used until World
    War I in 1917.

    Ludwig van Beethoven was a musical genius.
    He composed hundreds of songs in his lifetime.
    The first four notes of his Fifth Symphony---bom
    bom bom bommmmm---are the most famous
    in the world. These notes are played on a
    trombone. Beethoven was the first composer to
    use trombones in a symphony. A symphony is a
    very complex and beautiful song. Beethoven
    wrote nine symphonies in all. He said that he
    first composed symphonies in his head. He
    heard the part for every instrument in his mind
    before he wrote the first note on paper.
    Beethoven was born in 1770 in Bonn,
    Germany. His birthday was probably in
    December. Nobody is sure. He gave his first
    public performance at age seven. He wrote his
    first composition before he was 12. Sadly, at the
    age of 28, he started to go deaf. But he continued
    to compose music and to lead the orchestra. He
    never got married.
    After his death in 1827, friends found love
    letters that he had written to someone he called
    “Immortal Beloved.” To be immortal means to
    live forever. “Beloved” is a way of saying you love
    someone. His lover’s name still remains a mystery.
    For these reasons, and because of his wonderful
    music, he is remembered as a remarkable man in
    history. Perhaps no other composer has had
    such a large effect on the history of western
    music as Beethoven.

    M: Hello, everyone. My name is Franklin. I’m
    the president of the Greenville Stamp Collecting
    Club. Many people ask me why stamp collecting
    is such a popular hobby. There are several reasons.
    First, stamp collecting is inexpensive. Most
    letters come with stamps on them. All you need
    to do is remove the stamp from the envelope. It’s
    true that nowadays we may not get as many letters
    as we used to. In that case, you might want to
    buy your first set of stamps. Stamp dealers often
    sell a lot of stamps for only three dollars!
    Second, stamp collecting is educational.
    Stamps have pictures of everything from world
    leaders to endangered animals to various sports.
    It is interesting to learn about the people and
    things that are pictured on the stamps. It’s much
    more exciting than reading a boring history
    book.
    Also, stamp collecting can help build
    friendships between people from around the
    world. Stamp collectors in India, for example,
    can build stamp-trading friendships with people
    from Mexico. They can learn about each other’s
    culture while they exchange stamps.
    Finally, collecting stamps is something that
    families can do together. Parents and children
    can spend time enjoying the same hobby and
    build a closer relationship, instead of sitting in
    front of the television each night.
    So there you have four good reasons why
    stamp collecting is the world’s number one
    hobby. I hope you have enjoyed my talk. There
    are refreshments in the lobby. Thank you.

    B : Rock, paper, scissors? It sounds like an interesting
    sort of game! How do you play it?
    G : First, we each make a fist with our right hand,
    and then we shake our fists at the same time:
    one, two, three. On the count of three, you can
    keep your hand in a fist---that’s rock---or open
    your hand with the palm flat---that’s paper---or
    keep your fist, but put out your first and middle
    fingers---that’s scissors. The winner is the person
    who has the stronger item.
    B : That sounds stupid, because rocks are stronger
    than paper and scissors, so the rock will win
    every time.
    G : That’s true in real life, Tony, but that’s not how
    it works in this game. Rock can break scissors,
    but rock can be covered by paper, and paper can
    be cut by scissors. So rock defeats scissors, paper
    beats rock, and scissors beats paper.

    thing. I wonder who invented this game.

    Why are dogs often called “man’s best
    friend?” Probably because dogs have many of
    the qualities we want in our human companions.
    They are loyal, friendly, never argue, and are
    always glad to see us. This is one reason why we
    have dogs and other pets. Sometimes we might
    even prefer the company of animals to that of
    fellow human beings.
    Pets provide us with many other benefits as
    well. Studies have shown that having a pet nearby
    lowers the blood pressure of elderly people and
    raises their spirits. One study in Britain showed
    that people with pets recovered more quickly
    from heart attacks than those who didn’t have a
    pet. The study also found that pet owners suffered
    from fewer common ailments, such as colds,
    headaches, and fevers, than people who don’t
    own pets.
    Pets help children to learn responsibility. By
    learning to take care of their pets, children learn
    how to take care of themselves and other people.
    Walking dogs each day gives children regular
    exercise.
    Pets can also help keep us safe. Dogs, for
    example, guard our homes and scare away
    burglars. Guide dogs help blind people “see”
    when they need to go outside. Cats catch mice
    and rats in our houses.
    Finally, pets teach us compassion. They give
    us a chance to show our love to other living
    creatures. If we can love our pets, it becomes
    easier to love each other. And that might be the
    most important benefit of all!

    difficult for me to multiply and divide. Hey,
    Olaf, I heard that you’re excellent in math.
    B : My technique is that I try to imagine pictures in
    my mind, so the numbers aren’t just figures on a
    page, but something I can apply to real life. One
    way I do this is to imagine the numbers as if they
    were money. For example, if the equation is 753

    cents minus two dollars and 36 cents. It’s five
    dollars and 17 cents, or 517. Easy!
    G : Wow, that does seem easier, for adding and
    subtracting. But how do you apply this technique
    to multiplying and dividing?
    B : OK, suppose the equation is 200 times 30. 30 is
    three groups of 10. So, first I imagine 10 groups
    of people standing in a large field. Next to each
    group is a sign with the number 200 on it. At the
    front of the field is a huge sign with the number
    2,000 on it, because 200 times 10 equals 2,000,
    right? But the problem requires 200 times 10
    three times, so, I just add two more fields of
    people to my picture, with two more signs that
    say 2,000. Now I have 2,000 times three. The
    answer is 6,000!

    farms. They needed children to help them work. 
    Today, most families live in cities. Parents do
    not expect their children to work for them. It is
    also becoming very expensive to raise and educate
    children. Many parents cannot afford to have a
    large family. Others think that there are already
    too many people in the world. If they have more
    than two children, it will increase the population.
    Also, the types of families are changing.
    Statistics show that there are more single
    parents than ever before. More and more
    unmarried couples are having children, and a
    growing number of couples are choosing to have
    no children at all. Traditional families---a married
    couple with children---live in less than 25 percent
    of all US homes.
    One reason for this trend is the greater
    number of working women. In the past, women
    depended on their husbands for money. Now,
    many women have jobs. They don’t have to be
    married to have money. Another reason is
    divorce. This is when a husband and wife decide
    not to be married anymore. Almost half of all
    US marriages end in divorce. Many people
    decide not to get married at all. They prefer to
    be single and live without a husband or a wife.

    text: `
    How does your family make important
    decisions? Do children have any say in making
    these decisions, or do parents simply tell them
    what to do? There are several different methods
    for making family decisions.
    One method is to have a vote. Each family
    member writes his or her own choice on a piece
    of paper. With this method, each person gets
    equal say in the issue being decided. What if the
    vote is a tie? You should think of an idea to
    break a tie before you vote.
    A second method is to give older children
    special privileges. If you’re moving into a new
    home, for instance, the oldest child might get
    first choice of bedrooms.
    A third method is to take turns making the
    decisions. Suppose a family goes on vacation
    together each year. One year they might let their
    daughter decide where they should go. The next
    year, the choice goes to the son.
    A fourth method is to let the head of the
    household decide what is best. That is the way we
    do it in my family. The head of our household,
    my father, listens to all our opinions. Then he
    makes a decision. We agree to follow his decision,
    even if we don’t like it.
    Making family decisions is not always easy.
    The important thing is to choose a method that
    everyone agrees on. That could cause a problem,
    however. Which method should you use to decide
    which method to choose for making decisions?

    text: `
    The best teacher I’ve ever had was Mr.
    Lambert, my high school French teacher. He
    was short, with dark hair, a thick beard, and a
    big smile. His legs were short, too, so his arms
    always looked too long. He was a very good
    teacher because he always brought so much
    energy to the classroom. His classes were never
    boring because he was always active, trying to
    find new methods to communicate ideas.
    Because he taught French, English wasn’t
    allowed in class, so he often had to demonstrate
    the meaning of new words through gestures and
    acting.
    Once, he had to communicate the word
    “above” without saying it in English. First, he
    pulled a desk near the blackboard, and then
    put a wastebasket between the desk and the
    blackboard. Next, he put his feet on the edge of
    the blackboard and his hands on the desk so
    that he was above the wastebasket. I’ve never
    forgotten that demonstration. It was difficult
    not to enjoy the subject when he was so excited
    about teaching it.
    The most important reason that Mr.
    Lambert is the best teacher I’ve ever had is that
    he loved all his students, even when we made
    him angry by speaking English in class.
    Whenever that happened, the students always
    felt guilty because they had so much respect for
    him. Now that I’m a teacher, I try my best to be
    like Mr. Lambert. He is my role model.

    Hi! My name is Debra Garrel. I’m a 20-

    University. I love being at university. I’m enjoying
    my courses and I meet many new people every
    day. It seems like a new adventure, and I love
    adventures!
    I spent my childhood traveling all over the
    world and learning about different cultures. You
    see, my father works for the World Bank, so our
    family has always moved around a lot. I’ve lived
    in Mongolia, East Timor, Brazil, Nigeria, the
    Netherlands, and the United States. The hardest
    part of growing up was saying goodbye each
    time we had to move. But I would always
    remind myself that I would make new friends
    soon, and I always did. I’ve learned not to be
    shy!
    After leaving one place, I would always email
    or call my old friends. I would tell them about
    the new adventures I was having, and ask them
    about new things in their lives. That is probably
    the reason I chose to major in communications.
    I like to keep in touch.
    It’s obvious that I love to travel, isn’t it? But
    I also enjoy dancing, reading, going to the theater,
    and riding horses. If you share any of these
    interests and would like to learn more about me,
    please let me know. And if you have different
    interests, I’ll remind you: I’m always looking for
    a new adventure!

    title: "Unit 28 The Right Career",
    text: `
    People need to consider important factors
    when choosing a career. In my opinion, the most
    important factor is to choose a job that goes
    well with your personality. Are you an outgoing
    person who loves meeting new people and talking
    to them? Perhaps you should become a tour
    guide or a teacher. Are you shy? Maybe you
    should be an accountant or a scientist.
    Remember, you will do your job almost
    every day. If you have to change your personality
    when you work, you probably won’t be very
    happy. And neither will the people you work
    with. Nobody wants an unfriendly tour guide or
    an impatient teacher. Are you a moody person?
    In most jobs, you will be expected to control
    your emotions. That’s hard to do if your mood
    changes often. In that case, you might want to
    work alone. Perhaps you could be a writer or an
    artist.
    There are other factors to consider, such as
    salary and status. However, what good is a large
    salary or high status if you don’t like your job?
    You should consider your personality, find out
    what you are very good at doing, and then find
    the right career to go with all this. Too many
    people choose a career because it pays well. Too
    often, they find they don’t like their jobs. But by
    then they feel like they’re in a trap, and they
    can’t escape. Finding a good career is important.
    Think about it and choose carefully.

    text: `
    Did you know that words are not the only
    thing we use to communicate? Most of our
    messages are sent through body language. Only
    about 10 percent of communication is done
    through the actual words of a conversation. Isn’t
    that strange? If we understand body language well,
    we can learn a lot more about what other people
    really think. We can also use body language to
    send the right message to others. Have you ever
    felt dislike for someone without knowing why?
    Well, he or she might have been sending out a
    negative message through body language.
    What kind of things should you look for if
    you want to understand body language? First,
    look at people’s eyes. If people are lying, they
    may not look directly at the person they are
    talking to, and the pupils of their eyes may
    shrink. Next, look at people’s arms. Arms
    crossed in front of the body might mean a person
    is unfriendly or afraid. He or she might be trying
    to say, “Stay away.” If the arms are by the side
    or at the back of the body, the person might be
    saying, “Come closer. I won’t hurt you.” But
    keep in mind that there is no accurate way to
    interpret body language all the time. Sometimes,
    talking is still the best way to communicate.
    However, knowing about body language will
    improve the way you communicate and help you
    understand other people better

    If you like animals and science, you might
    want to be a veterinarian. Veterinarians are animal
    doctors. They take care of sick and injured
    animals. Like doctors, vets perform surgery and
    give medicine.
    When an animal is sick, vets examine it to
    find out why. They look for clues in the way an
    animal looks and acts. For example, if a dog is
    walking in a strange way, it might have injured
    its leg. Vets need to observe animals carefully,
    since animals cannot speak to tell anyone what
    is wrong.
    Vets prevent health problems in animals by
    giving vaccinations and check-ups and fixing
    teeth. They also teach owners how to feed and
    train their animals. Vets use special tools to
    perform surgery. They fix broken bones, take
    out tumors, take X-rays, and treat wounds.
    Most vets treat small pets, including dogs
    and cats. A few vets focus on large animals, such
    as sheep, cows, and horses. Large-animal vets
    usually drive to ranches and stables where their
    patients live. Often, they help when the animals
    give birth. Vets who work with large animals
    often work outside in all kinds of weather.
    A few vets work in zoos and aquariums.
    They care for zebras, sharks, and other wild
    creatures. Because animals can get sick at any
    time, vets often work long hours. Many vets like
    their work because they can be with animals every
    day, even though sick animals can sometimes bite
    or kick their vets.

    text: `
    A sneeze is a very interesting thing. We use
    many different muscles when we sneeze. These
    include stomach muscles, throat muscles, and
    eye muscles. Remember, our eyes always close
    during a sneeze.
    A sneeze begins when something gets inside
    your nose, like a tiny particle of dust. Your nose
    sends a message to your brain. Your brain sends
    messages to the muscles, getting them to work
    together in the correct order. When you sneeze,
    the dust that was in your nose flies out as fast as
    100 miles an hour! Usually something like dust
    or cold air makes us sneeze, but some people
    sneeze whenever they look at the sun. Some people
    think that your heart stops when you sneeze.
    Actually, it really doesn’t, but sometimes it
    might feel like it does.
    After someone sneezes, people often say
    “Bless you,” or “God bless you.” To bless
    someone means to wish them good and special
    things. Why do people say this? Long ago,
    people believed that this saying kept bad things
    from flying down your throat. Another story is
    that people thought this saying would help keep
    the person who sneezed from getting a very
    serious disease called the plague. At that time,
    the plague was killing thousands of people. It
    was thought that saying “God bless you” would
    protect people from getting this awful disease.
    Today, the saying is simply a nice way to wish
    someone well.

    In my opinion, snowboarding is more fun
    and exciting than skiing. When I ski, it feels really
    easy to control where I go and how I move. The
    ski poles make it very simple to change my
    direction. There are no poles in snowboarding,

    to understand the snow very well to make

    Some people think that the reduced amount

    you are standing on two skis. If you fall while

    M: My dad knows someone who works for Qantas
    Airlines, so we were able to get a good deal. The
    tickets were only $800 per person for a round
    trip.
    W: Wow, that is a good deal! When we went on
    vacation to Bangkok last year, it cost $1,000 for
    a round trip ticket, and Thailand’s closer than
    Australia.
    M: What did you like best about Thailand?
    W: Well, the food was delicious, and riding elephants
    was exciting, but I’d have to say that the beach
    was the best part. The only unpleasant part of
    the trip was after we got home, when we found
    out that the airline had lost some of our luggage.
    My father’s suitcase and my sister’s backpack
    were missing.
    M: So, the airline lost two pieces of luggage? How
    long did it take you to get them back?
    W: Three days, but the good news is that when they
    finally found them, they delivered them right to
    our front door.

    Airplane travelers can choose between three
    kinds of tickets: first class, business class, and
    economy class. Most people buy economy class
    tickets. They are cheaper, so travelers can go to
    more places more often. Business class is more
    expensive, with good seats and good service.
    First class is very expensive, but offers very
    comfortable seats and excellent service.
    In economy class, the seats are small and
    close together. There is not much leg room. In
    first class, the seats are huge and wider apart.
    There is lots of room for passengers to stretch
    their legs. Economy class passengers usually must
    all watch the same movie. First class passengers
    have their own TVs, and each person can watch
    different movies. Economy class passengers eat
    cheaper food. First class passengers are served
    delicious, fresh food. It is difficult to sleep in
    economy class because of the small seats and all
    the noise. In first class, the large seats can be
    pushed back to make a comfortable bed. There
    is a curtain between sections, so it is nice and
    quiet.
    Economy class is a good choice for short
    flights within the same country. Business class or
    first class is a good choice for business travelers
    taking an international flight across an ocean.
    These people often have to get off the plane and
    go right to work. For them, it is important to
    arrive fresh, rested, and ready for a full, exciting
    day
