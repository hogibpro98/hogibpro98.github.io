        W: That’s part of the responsibility, but there’s more. He needs a license and has to go to the vet to get shots. A dog also needs companionship. You can’t go off with your friends and leave him locked up in the house all day.<br>

      <p>Elephants are interesting. They are intelligent.
      They also have a great memory. You should
      always be kind to elephants. They remember
      everything. A woman from India told me a story.
      When she was a little girl, she knew of an evil
      elephant keeper. He often hit his elephant. He was
      very mean and cruel to the elephant. Then the evil
      keeper sold the elephant. The new keeper was a
      very kind man. Many years later, the evil keeper
      met the elephant again. The elephant remembered
      the evil man. He picked up a stone with his trunk and
      threw it at the evil man. The elephant still knew the
      man, even after so many years.</p>
      <p>Elephants help each other, too. Elephants use
      a special sound. The sound is so low that people
      cannot hear it. This sound travels really far.
      Groups of elephants can communicate with each
      other, even if they are far apart. This is very useful
      because it helps the elephants to find water and
      food. The elephants cooperate to help each other.<p>

    <p>When we arrived at the beach that day, the
    water was slick with oil and the white sand had
    turned black. It was an ugly sight. At first, the
    rescue workers would not let us on the beach.
    We had to watch from a distance. We watched
    as they put a huge float in the water, called a
    boom. This device kept the oil slick from
    spreading. Once they stopped the slick, we were
    allowed on the beach to help. Each of us was
    given a broom. We swept the oil into a pile. The
    workers took it away in big trucks. We all
    worked very hard that day to restore the beach.</p>
    <p>Once the oil was removed, the birds that had
    been caught in the oil had to be helped. The
    workers showed us how to remove the oil from
    their wings. Then the birds could fly away to
    safety. We were very proud of ourselves that day.
    We helped save our beautiful beach and the
    birds who visit it.</p>

    literature, economics, and peace. The Nobel
    Prize is named after Alfred Nobel. He was born
    in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1833. Alfred Nobel
    invented dynamite in 1866. Dynamite is used in
    mining, construction, and war. Before he died, he
    wrote that all of his money should be used to
    create the Nobel Prize. He died in 1896. The
    first prize was given in 1901.</p>
    <p>Each prize has three parts: a diploma, a gold
    medal, and money. The money has increased
    since 1980. It is now ten million Swedish crowns.
    This is about one million euros. How are the
    winners chosen? Five committees secretly meet to
    pick the winners. The Nobel Prize for Economics
    is the only one that is not decided that way. That
    is because it was created in 1956 by the Bank of
    Sweden in honor of the fiftieth anniversary of
    Alfred Nobel’s death. The Bank of Sweden decides
    who gets the Nobel Prize for Economics. Since

    <p>What makes a painting a great work of art?
    There are many answers to that question. Some
    people think that a painting should look pretty.
    Others disagree. The skill of the painter is
    important. The techniques used are also important.
    Most of all, a great painting has meaning. A
    great painting has a special element in it.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, a painter’s special element is the
    way he portrays his or her feelings in a piece of
    art. An example of this is Picasso’s painting,
    Guernica. It has strange shapes in it. It shows
    suffering people, too. It is not a very pretty picture.
    However, it makes people understand Picasso’s
    feelings about war.</p>
    <p>Other times, the element is a memory or feeling.
    This comes from inside another person. Someone
    may see a painting and be reminded of a beautiful
    memory. A painting can also remind people of a
    feeling. For example, Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona
    Lisa is very popular. Many people like her smile.
    Some people say it is a mysterious smile. Others
    say it is a happy one. Still others make up stories
    about the woman in the painting.</p>
    <p>Which element is the most important? Is it
    the skill of the artist or the feelings of the person

    <p>When someone does an activity that is not a

    called a hobby. Most people enjoy hobbies during
    their free time. Some people spend a lot of time
    on their hobbies. There are nearly as many kinds
    of hobbies, as there are people. A hobby can be
    about making or collecting things, or enjoying an
    experience.</p>
    <p>Creative hobbies are popular. Some creative
    hobbies are writing, drawing, and making pottery.
    A lot of people like making jewelry or clothes.
    People who do these kinds of hobbies sometimes
    become writers or artists when they retire.</p>
    <p>Collecting is also popular. Most collectors used
    to buy coins, stamps, or baseball cards. Today,
    toys, games, and model cars are trendy. Collectors
    buy and sell things on the Internet. They also shop
    online in stores all around the world.</p>
    <p>Enjoying an experience is a hobby, too. Some
    people listen to music. Others watch movies or
    read books. Many people travel or play sports.
    Helping people is a hobby. There are places you
    can help build houses for poor families. You can
    help feed the homeless at soup kitchens. You can
    also tutor children or help the elderly.</p>
    <p>A hobby is something that is done for fun.
    With so many choices, there is no reason not to

    <p>Everyone gets a cold now and then. Doctors
    cannot cure colds. Sleep and rest are good for taking
    care of a cold. However, in almost every culture,
    most families have a home remedy for colds. These
    remedies are passed down from parents to children.
    They have changed very little over time.</p>
    <p>Different cultures use different ingredients.
    In Mexico, cinnamon, raisins, oregano, and hot
    water are used to make a special tea. Honey is
    sometimes added. A fruit called genipap is used
    as a cold remedy in Puerto Rico. The fruit is cut
    up. It is then soaked in water. Sugar can be added
    to make it sweet. Chicken soup is popular in
    America. A large chicken is boiled in a pot.
    Carrots, onions, garlic, and other vegetables are
    usually added. Ginger tea is used to help a cold in
    China. A ginger root is peeled. It is then crushed.
    The ginger is boiled for about thirty minutes.
    Some honey can be added after it is done.</p>
    <p>Each family usually has a home remedy for
    a cold. Some remedies work. Some do not. Some
    taste good. Others do not. No matter what,
    home remedies are sure to be around for a long
    time.</p>

    W: No, that’s a misconception. Everyone thinks coffee

    M: Really?<br>
    W: According to an article I read, coffee can be
    beneficial to your health.<br>
    M: That’s interesting. But you should remember
    that one study does not prove much. There are
    a lot of other studies out there, too.<br>
    W: This doctor in Italy found a lot of benefits.<br>
    M: Such as?<br>
    W: She says the chemicals in coffee can be good for
    your heart and may relieve headaches, too.
    M: I know that some coffee can be good sometimes,
    but drinking too much is not beneficial. Coffee
    has a lot of caffeine, which is addictive. It affects
    your blood circulation and removes calcium
    from your bones.<br>
    W: The doctor did admit that it is not for everyone,
    and that you shouldn’t drink more than three
    cups a day.<br>
    M: You seem nervous when you drink a lot. And
    remember when you told me that you are not
    sleeping well? Do you think that maybe you
    should cut back?<br>
    W: I appreciate your concern. I was thinking of
    cutting back. Would you like a cup of green tea?

    <p>Soccer is one of the most popular sports in
    the world. Although the main idea of the game
    is easy to understand, there are many rules to be
    followed.</p>
    <p>A player gets a yellow card for not following
    the rules. A yellow card is a warning. If a player
    keeps breaking the rules, he gets a red card.
    When this happens, he cannot play anymore. He
    is ejected from the game.</p>
    <p>Another rule is about “handling.” “Handling”
    is when another player touches the ball with his
    hands on purpose. Players cannot handle the ball.
    A player may not do anything that is dangerous
    to another player. He cannot kick an opponent’s
    legs to get the ball.</p>
    <p>There are also some lesser-known rules. A
    player is not allowed to impede an opponent.
    This means that a player cannot purposely slow
    down another player on the field. A penalty can
    be called if this occurs. There is a rule about
    blocking a goalkeeper, too. A yellow card or an
    indirect kick can be given to the opponent’s
    team if a player tries this. Yes, soccer is full of
    rules!</p>

    text: `
    <p>Asking for directions can be risky. I realized
    exactly how risky it could be when I needed to
    meet one of my friends one day.</p>
    <p>A while ago, I arranged to meet my friend at
    a new mall. My friend had been there before and
    indicated that we should shop there together.
    We planned to meet at 3:00 p.m. at Burger
    Palace in the mall.</p>
    <p>When I arrived at the mall, I realized I did not
    know where Burger Palace was, so I asked a
    woman for directions. She advised me to go
    straight past the bank, and turn right before the
    food court. She mentioned that I would walk
    for a few minutes, passing a shoe store until I
    reached Burger Palace, which was next to the
    bookstore. I followed her directions and arrived
    just in time.</p>
    <p>Twenty minutes later, I was beginning to
    wonder where my friend was. Thirty minutes
    later, I was worried. I did not know what to do,
    so I just kept waiting. At around 3:40 p.m., I saw
    my friend walking quickly toward me. I rushed to
    him and demanded to know what happened. “I
    was at the other Burger Palace!” he cried. We
    had not realized there were two Burger Palaces
    in the mall.</p>
    <p>Since then, I have made sure that I get the
    directions from my friends before I go to meet
    them. It saves me a lot of trouble!</p>

    text: `
    <p>When your car gets a flat tire, do not panic.
    First, apply your brakes and pull over. Inside
    the trunk, you will find a spare tire and a toolbox. </p>
    <p>AOne of these tools is a jack, which is a tool
    you use to raise the car. This makes the tire easy to
    remove. Position the jack beneath the car, behind
    the tire that is flat. Insert the jack handle and turn
    it clockwise. Continue turning the handle until the
    car rises high enough, so that the flat tire is well
    off the ground and spins freely. Make sure that the
    jack is securely supporting the vehicle. If the car is
    unsteady or the jack is unstable, lower the car.
    Reposition the jack and begin again.</p>
    <p>Next, use a crowbar to pry off the hubcap
    (the metal cover on the side of the tire). Inside
    the hubcap are four bolts that hold the tire in
    place. Loosen these, using the long L-shaped
    tool. Push firmly on the tool to get the bolts to
    turn. It may be difficult.</p>
    <p>Once the bolts are loose, the flat tire can be
    pulled off easily. Now you can put on the new
    tire. Once it is in place, replace the four bolts and
    tighten them. Place the flat tire and the toolbox
    back in the trunk.</p>
    <p>Finally, drive to the nearest service station
    and get your flat tire fixed!</p>

    M: One moment, please, and I will look it up. The

    exchange rate is 200 bolivars per dollar.<br>

    I arrive? I will probably need more cash, and I
    want to find a reliable exchange.<br>
    M: The best place to exchange money is at a large
    bank. They will always give you the official rate.
    You can also find money exchange stores in
    most large cities.<br>
    W: Wonderful. I will look for a bank. I appreciate
    your advice.<br>
